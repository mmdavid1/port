            <p>
              Hey, i'm Matt! an undergrad at UC San Diego studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently work as a student Product Manager at the <Link href="https://lei.ucsd.edu">Lab for Emerging Intelligence</Link> , where we are developing a Smart Learning Hub to enhance student's educational experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also work at Biology Computing Services, where I work as a student developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy surfing and staying active.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
           <p>The democratization of software development through no-code and low-code platforms is reshaping how we build and deliver products. As an aspiring Product Manager, I'm fascinated by how these tools are enabling rapid prototyping and iteration, allowing teams to validate ideas faster and deliver value more efficiently. I'm particularly interested in how this shift enables product teams to focus more on user needs and innovative solutions rather than technical implementation details.
          </p>
          <p>
            The evolution of human-computer interaction through emerging technologies like gesture recognition and brain-computer interfaces presents exciting opportunities for product innovation. I'm passionate about identifying which use cases can truly benefit from these advanced interfaces, and how to implement them in ways that genuinely enhance user experience. My focus is on balancing technological capabilities with user needs, ensuring that these innovations solve real problems and create meaningful value for users. This includes studying user adoption patterns, conducting user research, and developing product strategies that effectively integrate these technologies into existing product ecosystems.
