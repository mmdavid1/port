## TLDR

I helped Sarah build out her e-commerce site [Seay Vintage](https://seayvintage.com/) to sell clothes she thrifts.

## Project

The website is hosted on Framer, and uses the Framer CMS. While more on the costly side, Framer makes it very easy to add/remove products (Through their CMS) and update other components. This is great for people who don't want to deal with coding.

The payment processing part of the site is done through Stripe. We created a collection in stripe and inserted the links as the payment gateway, redirecting the users to stripe.

## What I learned

It was very rewarding to be able to help someone with a goal of theirs, and empower them through tech.
